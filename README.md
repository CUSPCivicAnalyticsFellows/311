# New York City's 311 Service: can we predict complaints and does everyone have equal access?

311 is New York City's non-emergency customer service department, which handles all quality of life concerns posed by the public.  Its mission is to improve municipal government by responding to citizen complaints. 

The 2016-2017 New York University Civic Analytics Fellows developed a method for quantifying 311 complaint utilization by analyzing heat and hot water complaints and heat and hot water violations given specific building and population features.

Our work was recently accepted to the Bloomberg Data For Good Conference, hosted in NYC on September 2014, 2017. https://www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/
