# New York City's 311 Service: can we predict complaints and does everyone have equal access?

311 is New York City's non-emergency customer service department, which handles all quality of life concerns posed by the public.  Its mission is to improve municipal government by responding to citizen complaints. 

The 2016-2017 New York University Civic Analytics Fellows are analyzing the distribution of heat and hot water complaints across the city in order to determine the probability of complaining (given specific features) and to determine the equity of access of the service.
